<p style="text-align: left;">
Hi there! I am a second year undergraduate student at Northeastern University studying Health Science in the Bouvé College of Health Sciences. My education interests lie in the realm of public health. I'm incredibly passionate about advocacy for public health, specifically for environmental health justice. Currently, I am writing a literature review as a "Health Equity Research Intern" about using public art as a mechanism for educating the public on the threats climate change poses to health. 

My other research interests include epidemiology and biostatistics. I am also proficient in the coding language R! My professional goals align with pursing graduate school to obtain an MPH and then a PhD in environmental health. Aside from academics, I run my own photography business - Riley G Photography - where I work with clients for portraiture and sell prints of landscapes/cityscapes!
